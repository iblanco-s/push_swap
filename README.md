# Push_swap

This project aims to create a highly efficient sorting algorithm for two stacks with a limited number of instructions. The algorithm is based on the radix sorting method, but implemented in binary. The project is written in C and does not use any external libraries.

## Algorithm Overview 🧑‍💻
The algorithm used in this project is a variation of the radix sort, specifically adapted for binary numbers. It utilizes two stacks to sort the input data. The sorting process is performed in multiple passes, where each pass sorts the numbers based on a specific bit position.
